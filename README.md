# <img width="45" src=pics/work.png> AdventureWorks Workforce Evaluation

## Introduction

This project focused on the workforces & analytics about the sample dataset: AdventureWorks. 

The HR Manager wants to better understand how they are doing, and I was asked to answer HR's questions and develop some analytics/insights using the data file provided. 

In order to better display the dataset, I created an Entity Relationship Diagram with 'datamodelr' package in `R`, merged *100,000+* data from *10+* tables, analyzed the data, and then generated the R-markdown report as well as the `Tableau` Dashboard for better interpretation and presentation.
